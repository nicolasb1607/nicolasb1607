üëã Hello there! I'm Nicolas, a tech enthusiast with a passion for both front-end and back-end technologies.

ü§ù I thrive in collaborative environments and have a strong background in working as part of a team, where I've learned the value of effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.

üí° I believe in the power of continuous learning, and I'm always eager to **explore new technologies** and expand my skill set. The tech world is constantly evolving, and I'm excited to stay ahead of the curve.

üíº Currently, I'm actively **seeking new opportunities and am available for work**. If you're looking for someone who is not only skilled but also a dedicated learner and team player, feel free to reach out!

Let's connect and create something amazing together! üöÄ
